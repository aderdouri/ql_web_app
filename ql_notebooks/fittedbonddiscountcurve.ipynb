        "Use code with caution.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "Key Considerations and Changes:\n",
        "PyFlatZero Fitting Method:\n",
        "The C++ test defines a custom FlatZero fitting method. I've created a Python equivalent PyFlatZero inheriting from ql.FittedBondDiscountCurveFittingMethod.\n",
        "The clone() method from C++'s FittingMethod interface is not automatically part of Python's custom class unless explicitly required by SWIG for certain internal operations. I've commented it out for now, assuming direct use in Python doesn't need it. If QuantLib's internals try to clone it and fail, this would need to be implemented.\n",
        "The PyFlatZero constructor now correctly passes the constraint argument to the base class ql.FittedBondDiscountCurveFittingMethod.\n",
        "FittedBondDiscountCurve Constructor:\n",
        "The Python constructor signatures can vary (e.g., taking referenceDate or settlementDays, calendar). I've used the referenceDate version primarily.\n",
        "testFlatExtrapolation - resetGuess:\n",
        "The C++ code has curve1->resetGuess(...). Python's FittedBondDiscountCurve doesn't expose a direct resetGuess method that refits with a new initial guess post-construction. The fitting is done in the constructor.\n",
        "To simulate this, I've created a new FittedBondDiscountCurve instance (curve1_refit) with the new guess. This is the most straightforward way to achieve the same effect in Python if the original object cannot be internally refit with a new starting guess.\n",
        "The model prices (modelPrices1_clean) and yields need to be recalculated using this curve1_refit for the second part of the assertion.\n",
        "QL_CHECK_CLOSE:\n",
        "The C++ macro QL_CHECK_CLOSE(a, b, N) checks if std::abs(a-b) <= N * std::abs(a)/100 (approximately, it's a relative tolerance of N%).\n",
        "In Python, self.assertAlmostEqual(a, b, delta=...) is used. For relative tolerance, the delta needs to be calculated based on the expected value and the desired relative tolerance (e.g., delta = abs(expected_value) * relative_tol_percentage / 100.0). I've implemented direct relative difference checks where QL_CHECK_CLOSE was used with a percentage.\n",
        "Error Handling:\n",
        "BOOST_CHECK_EXCEPTION with ExpectedErrorMessage is translated to self.assertRaisesRegex(ExceptionType, \"regex_for_message\").\n",
        "Bond Definitions: The bond constructions are replicated as closely as possible, including schedules, day counters, and coupon rates.\n",
        "Yield Calculation: bond.yieldRate(...) is used in Python where C++ used bond->yield(...). Parameters for compounding and frequency are matched.\n",
        "Dates and Settings: ql.Settings.instance().evaluationDate is set at the beginning of tests or setUp for reproducibility.\n",
        "std::make_shared and ext::make_shared: These C++ smart pointer creations map to direct object instantiation in Python (e.g., ql.ZeroCouponBond(...)).\n",
        "Handle<Quote>: make_quote_handle helper is used for consistency.\n",
        "Array() vs None for Optional Args: When a C++ function takes an optional Array (like NelsonSiegelFitting for weights or l2penalty), passing an empty ql.Array() or None (if the binding supports it) is the Python equivalent. I've used ql.Array() for empty arrays and None for optional OptimizationMethod pointers."
