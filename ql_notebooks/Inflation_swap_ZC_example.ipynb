        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Imports and Setup:** Import `QuantLib` and `datetime`.\n",
        "2.  **Evaluation Date & Market Setup:** Define the date for which the pricing is performed (`eval_date`). Set up basic calendar and conventions.\n",
        "3.  **Discount Curve:** A nominal yield curve is needed to discount all cash flows to the present value. Here, a simple `FlatForward` curve is used for demonstration. In reality, this would be bootstrapped from market instruments (like OIS swaps for collateralized pricing).\n",
        "4.  **Inflation Index:** Define the specific index (e.g., `UKRPI`). Key parameters are `observation_lag` (how long before the reference period end the fixing is published) and `interpolated` (whether index values are linearly interpolated between official fixing dates, common for swaps). Historical fixings around the evaluation date are crucial, especially for interpolation and handling the observation lag correctly.\n",
        "5.  **Inflation Term Structure:** This curve represents the market's expectation of future inflation. It's bootstrapped here using `ZeroCouponInflationSwapHelper` objects created from market ZCIS quotes. The `PiecewiseZeroInflationCurve_LogLinear` class constructs the curve. This curve is essential for forecasting future inflation index levels or rates.\n",
        "6.  **ZCIS Definition:** Create the `ZeroCouponInflationSwap` object, specifying whether you pay or receive the fixed rate (`Payer`/`Receiver`), notional, dates, the fixed rate, the inflation index, and the observation lag.\n",
        "7.  **YoYIS Definition:**\n",
        "    *   First, create a `YoYInflationIndex`. This special index uses the bootstrapped *inflation term structure* (`inflation_curve_handle`) to forecast future *year-on-year* inflation rates.\n",
        "    *   Define payment schedules (`MakeSchedule`) for both the fixed and inflation legs.\n",
        "    *   Create the `YearOnYearInflationSwap` object, specifying type, notional, schedules, fixed rate, day counters, the YoY index, and the observation lag.\n",
        "8.  **Pricing Engine:** The `DiscountingSwapEngine` is used. It takes the *nominal discount curve* handle. The engine automatically picks up the correct inflation curve forecasting mechanism via the inflation index object attached to the swap.\n",
        "9.  **Pricing:**\n",
        "    *   `.setPricingEngine()` assigns the engine to the swap instruments.\n",
        "    *   `.NPV()` calculates the Net Present Value.\n",
        "    *   `.fairRate()` calculates the fixed rate that would make the swap's NPV zero.\n",
        "10. **Cash Flows (Optional):** Demonstrates how to access the individual legs (`.leg(0)`, `.leg(1)`) and iterate through the cash flows (`ql.Coupon`, `ql.FixedRateCoupon`, `ql.YoYInflationCoupon`) to inspect payment dates, accrual periods, and calculated/forecasted amounts and rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a solid foundation for pricing inflation swaps in QuantLib. Remember to replace the illustrative market data with actual market quotes and build more robust curves for real-world applications."
